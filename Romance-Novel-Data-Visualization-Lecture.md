**What Is The Goal of Data Visualization?** 
* --Visual Proof--: A great data visualization provides proof that our data shows what we have described in words. You can certainly take what I say at face value, but critically, you should expect me to show it to you. As scientist, we strive to be worthy of our readers' trust and data visualizations can assist with that.
* --Data Storytelling--: A picture is worth 1000 words! If you generate a great visualization it can adequately communicate many pieces of information. Let's say we are looking at trends in sales of different colored widgets: red widgets, blue widgets, green widgets, and yellow widgets. We could plot a single line showing how many people purchased widgets between 2020 and 2025. Take a look at the visualization shown below. What does it tell us about our data?
