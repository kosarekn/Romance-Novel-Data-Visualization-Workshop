**What Is The Goal of Data Visualization?** 
--
* **Visual Proof**: A great data visualization provides proof that our data shows what we have described in words. You can certainly take what I say at face value, but critically, you should expect me to show it to you. As scientist, we strive to be worthy of our readers' trust and data visualizations can assist with that.

* **Data Storytelling**: A picture is worth 1000 words! If you generate a great visualization it can adequately communicate many pieces of information. Let's say we are looking at trends in sales of different colored widgets: red widgets, blue widgets, green widgets, and yellow widgets. We could plot a single line showing how many people purchased widgets between 2020 and 2025 or I could plot four different lines, each for the sale of different colored widgets. Take a look at these visualizations. What do they tell us about our data? 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/images/trends.png" width="1000" alt="Trend-Line">
</div>

The plot on the right shows us that the number of sales for red, blue, and green widgets increases over the 2020-2025 time period, but the sales for yellow widgets decreases! We wouldn't have known that had we not broken down or visualization by the groups within our "Color" variable. By the way, this reversal of trends when looking at subgroups of our variable is known as **Simpson's Paradox**.

* **Presentation Purposes**: A visualization will not only summarize your information, but will clearly communicate your findings in a memorable way. Humans remember things that they see! Some of my earliest memories are not auditory, but rather visual. I remember the color of shirt my Grandma wore when she came to pick me up from shool one day.

**What Makes A Good Visualization?**
--
* **Clear Titles and Axis Labels**: If you generate a histogram, please for the love of all that is good, do not title this histogram, "Histogram" with axes "X" and "Y". If you handed anyone on the street that visualization, they might say that you have made a lovely histogram. Of what? Who is to say. Descriptive titles might be something like, "Distribution of Widget Sale Between 2020-2025" with axis labels "Count" and "Frequency".

* **Clearly Distinguishable Colorblind Friendly Colors**: Choosing colors that are not easily distinguished from other another might mislead a reader. Further, 1 in 12 males are colorblind. Really. Here's a [reference](https://www.nei.nih.gov/eye-health-information/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness) for that. We will talk about how you can choose colorblind friendly colors later in this lecture.

* **Data Storytelling**: Your visualizations should tell a cohesive story. It's imperitive not to add distracting bells and whitles to your visualizations, rather, focus on the pieces of informtion you want your reader to gain. 

* **Know Your Audience**: Would you show your 5-year-old cousin the same graphic you would show your work collegue? Probably not. Gear your visualizations to the audience who will see them 

**How Can We Create Good Visualizations?**
--
* **Focus on Your Question**: When creating a plot, or series of plots, make sure to focus on our study question. Ask yourself how each figure supports the question you are trying to answer. Taken together all of the plots you generate should 

* **Focus on Your Findings**: If you want to know if more males or females purchsed green widgets, spend some time thinking about which visualization will most adequately help you find the answer to this question.

* **Use Programming**: You came to this workshop for a reason, did you not? Generating figures using a programming language will give you the power to fine tune your visualizations and step outside of conventionally used visualizations that can be generated by point and click tools. Plus, they are PRETTY.
